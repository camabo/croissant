    <h1>Croissants</h1>
    <p>Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
        several
        times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
        layered,
        flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.</p>
